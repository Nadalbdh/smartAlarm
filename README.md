# Smart Alarm System

The Smart Alarm System is an integrated solution for managing alarms and monitoring sleep patterns. It combines an Angular frontend, a Laravel backend, and Python scripts for data collection and analysis. It's main goal is to promote better sleep by collecting enough data about the user's sleep stages to try and wake them up during the optimal stage in their four-stage sleep. This is done to avoid grogginess, fatigue and irritation.
